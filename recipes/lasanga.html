                                    <li>2 (24 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce</li>
            
                                        <li> 2 cups water</li>
            
                                            <li> 1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
            
                                                <li> 1 drizzle olive oil</li>
            
                                                    <li> 1 ½ cups whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>

                                                                <li> 1 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to be followed</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. Remove and discard casings.</li>

            <li> Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add sausages and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until sausage begins to brown, and onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.</li>
            
                <li> Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off heat and reserve until needed. Before using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface.</li>
            
                    <li>  While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions on the package call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a large mixing bowl.</li>
            
                        <li>  Carefully add the meat sauce and stir until thoroughly combined. Let rest for 5 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
